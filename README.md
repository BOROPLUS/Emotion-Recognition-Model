# 🎵 Speech Emotion Recognition Project

This project performs emotion classification on speech audio using a CNN-LSTM deep learning model. It supports uploading audio files or recording live audio input via a Streamlit web interface.

## 📁 Structure

- `Emotion_Recognition_Pipeline.ipynb`: Full notebook for model training, validation, and saving.
- `app.py`: Streamlit app for emotion prediction from user audio.
- `emotion_model.h5`: Trained Keras model.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies.
- `README.md`: You're reading it!

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
